# AI Image Classifier

A simple web-based AI tool that can identify objects in images using TensorFlow.js and MobileNet.

## Features

- Upload any image and get AI-powered predictions
- Real-time image processing
- Visual confidence scores
- Works entirely in your browser
- No server required
- Beautiful, responsive design

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Wait for the AI model to load (you'll see a loading spinner)
3. Click "Choose Image" to upload any picture
4. The AI will analyze the image and show what it sees
5. Each prediction comes with a confidence score

## Technical Details

- Uses TensorFlow.js for machine learning
- MobileNet model for image classification
- Pure JavaScript implementation
- No backend required
- Works offline once loaded

## Learning Opportunities

This project is perfect for learning about:
- Machine Learning basics
- Image processing
- AI model integration
- Web development with AI
- Confidence scores in AI

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - Styling and layout
- `script.js` - AI model integration and image processing
- `README.md` - This file

## Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection (only needed for initial model download)

## How it Works

1. The app loads the MobileNet model when you open the page
2. When you upload an image, it's processed by the AI model
3. The model analyzes the image and returns predictions
4. Each prediction shows what was detected and how confident the AI is

## Tips for Learning

1. Try different types of images to see how the AI responds
2. Pay attention to confidence scores
3. Experiment with the code to understand how it works
4. Try modifying the UI or adding new features

## Troubleshooting

If you see any errors:
1. Make sure you're using a modern browser
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Make sure all files are in the same directory
